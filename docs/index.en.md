# Renormalization Group

These are self-study notes on **Renormalization Group** theory. To document my learning process, I've structured the notes into articles and written [Python code](https://github.com/Liu-Zhihang/Renormalization-Group/tree/main/code) to deepen my understanding.

## Course Overview

Renormalization Group (RG) provides a systematic framework to understand how physical laws change with scale—from critical phenomena and phase transitions to quantum field theory. These notes cover motivation, statistical mechanics foundations, critical exponents, and scaling laws.
